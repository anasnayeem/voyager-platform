Project Name:
Cloud-Native Middleware Integration Platform on GCP

Project Objective
To build a cloud-based platform that integrates, deploys, automates, and manages enterprise middleware services using best practices from both DevOps and Middleware domains. You will simulate the operations of a modern IT integration team by:

Automating infrastructure provisioning.

Deploying and orchestrating middleware and applications.

Implementing CI/CD for rapid development and deployment.

Exposing all key services securely and scalably.

Managing, monitoring, and updating clusters via a centralized dashboard.

What Will This Platform Do?
Provision infrastructure and clusters on GCP using Terraform and Ansible.

Deploy two Kubernetes clusters: one using Rancher RKE and another with OpenShift (OKD).

Centralize management of both clusters with Rancher Dashboard.

Deploy middleware apps: Sterling Integrator (for B2B/B2C messaging) and Apache/TC Server (for legacy/web apps).

Expose all services through Nginx (reverse proxy/load balancer), which will be the public entrypoint for your platform.

Automate builds and deployments with Jenkins and Helm.

Manage all configs as code (IaC, CI/CD, K8s manifests, Helm charts).

How Each Tool Fits In
Tool	Role in Project
GCP	Main cloud provider (VMs, networking, GKE, storage, IAM, etc.)
Terraform	Provisions all cloud resources (VMs, networks, clusters)
Ansible	Bootstraps VMs, installs Docker/K8s, configures middleware
Rancher RKE	Creates and manages a Kubernetes cluster on GCP VMs
OpenShift (OKD)	Creates a second K8s cluster for hybrid scenario
Rancher Dashboard	Manages both RKE and OpenShift clusters from a single GUI
Sterling Integrator	Runs as a StatefulSet in K8s for integration workflows
Apache/TC Server	Hosts a sample Java/web app, deployed via Helm
Jenkins	CI/CD serverâ€”builds Docker images, runs tests, triggers deploys
Helm	Packages and deploys all K8s apps (Sterling, Nginx, Jenkins, etc.)
Nginx	Acts as reverse proxy/load balancer for all public endpoints

High-Level Architecture (Workflow):
Infrastructure Layer

Use Terraform to create GCP resources (VMs, networks, firewall rules, optionally GKE).

Use Ansible to install Docker, Kubernetes, Rancher RKE, OpenShift, and required dependencies.

Kubernetes Layer

Deploy two clusters (RKE & OpenShift) on GCP VMs.

Use Rancher Dashboard to centrally manage both clusters.

Application Layer

Deploy Sterling Integrator as a StatefulSet (simulates integration workloads).

Deploy Apache/TC Server (simulates a legacy web application).

Use Jenkins for CI/CD (build/push Docker images, trigger Helm deployments).

Use Helm to package and deploy all apps to K8s clusters.

Expose Jenkins UI, Sterling Integrator, Apache/TC Server through Nginx reverse proxy/load balancer.

Entry Point

Nginx (deployed as K8s Deployment and Service) receives all external traffic, does SSL termination, and routes to backend services based on path/rules.

User Stories/Scenarios:
A new integration workflow needs to go live: Jenkins builds a Docker image, pushes it, and Helm deploys it to RKE. Nginx exposes it via reverse proxy.

Onboard a new cluster: Use Rancher Dashboard to import/manage OpenShift cluster.

Blue/Green deploys: Update Sterling or Apache/TC Server with zero downtime using Helm and K8s.

Scale up/down: Manage replicas through Rancher Dashboard or kubectl.

Disaster recovery: Destroy and re-provision everything automatically with Terraform and Ansible.

Key Deliverables:
Terraform scripts for GCP infra.

Ansible playbooks for provisioning/bootstrapping.

Jenkins pipelines for CI/CD.

Helm charts for all applications.

Nginx config for reverse proxy/load balancer.
